# Databases

You'll see two directories here:

## localhost

You will need this if you are doing stuff with the backend on your local computer:

- you are running the development server
- you are running backend tests on your local computer

## cloudsql

You will need this if:

- you are running database migrations for a cloud hosted application
- you need to examine the state of a cloud database
