Different sessions take precidence over others, so it makes sense to add people to sessions in the right sequence:

# Generating sessions

## Regular learners 

1. create_fundamental_skill_sessions
Here we set up spot checks to make sure people are doing ok, and we help people who are clearly struggling 

2. add_prov_learners_to_sessions 
We look for gaps from (1) and invite prov learners where we can 

TODO: Need to check with Ryan what is enough here. We might need to do more work or change the algorithm.

3. create_problem_solving_foundation_sessions 
This is for people failing PSF. If they already have basic skill rescue sessions scheduled then it wont make so much sense to do this for them.

Before this is run, we need to get the latest CB test data and adjust PSF levels 

4. create_card_progress_sessions 
This is for people who are falling behind in their syllabus 

## Bootcamps 

1. create_bootcamp_sessions 
That's it

# Allocating staff and time slots 


# Sending invites / syncing to google calendar 


# Getting attendance data
TODO
