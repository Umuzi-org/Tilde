I'm marking your code as Not Yet Competent because our standards are actually pretty high.

You gave us code that was good enough to get you through bootcamp, we can see you have the aptitude for this stuff. But for now on you will need to be writing professional level code.

That means your code must be sparkley and clean, neat and tidy, well named and well formatted. One day when you are working on a team of rock star professional developers they'll all think you are a friggin ninja because your code will be the most beautiful code they've seen.

Please go through everything and make sure that:

- there are no global variables used in functions
- all variable names make sense
- all names are consistent with the style of your language
- you don't have any comments that just rewrite the code in English

- Make sure you use the `black` formatter to make your code nice and pretty. You can install it and then set up vscode so it auto-formats your code every time you hit save
