But in this case exception handling is not the best thing. You could just use a perfectly normal if statement.\n\nWhy? Because good code is clear and makes its intention clear.\n\nThis would be easier to read:\n```\ndef square(num, char=\"#\"):\n    if num <= 0:\n        raise ValueError('Enter num greater than 0')\n    [print(char * num) for j in range(num)]\n     \n```\n\nThe following is also a bad habit:\n\n```\nreturn(lst1)\n```\n\nIt looks like you think return is a function, or maybe you are trying to return a tuple.\n\nThis is better:\n\n```\nreturn lst1\n```\n\nAnd this would be even better:\n\n```\nreturn(list1) # notice the use of words that actually exist. Why invent new spelling when we already have perfectly good spelling?\n```\n\nI can definately see you know stuff, overall this is quite good. But there are still lessons",

Generally speaking, good code is clear code. Names should be well chosen in order to convey intention.\n\nSimilarly `neg_to_pos = max(num, -num)`. `neg_to_pos` sounds like a function name, but it's a value. Maybe `size` is a good name. Nouns are for variables, verbs are better for functions. Functions do stuff, so do verbs.\n\n`max_str_len = \"\"`. Maximum string length sounds like it should be an integer. Maybe you want to use this variable to store the `longest_word`\n\nOther than that stuff it's looking very good. I can see you have a good grasp of the concepts covered.
