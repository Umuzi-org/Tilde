## Prerequisite knowledge 

This project makes use of a number of different technologies. It's worth knowing a bit about them before digging in:

- React
- Storybook: If you are just making visual components then this is a good place to start. Also if you are creating a whole new component then it is generally worth making a story for it before you build in too much cleverness
- Material UI: This is our primary component library, you don't need to be an expert to just use it. It's very easy to get started
- Redux: The official tutorial is the best one. Most of the time this isn't needed. No need to learn this if `state` does the trick for what you are working on
- Redux saga: This is only required if you are working with Redux and need to handle side effects
