# Tilde

## What is Tilde?

It is an open source, agile, collaborative learning platform. Chock full of wholesome goodness.

It was designed by devs for devs. The idea is that people should learn to code in a way that feels the same as working on a real dev team. From the student's point of view it is a kanban board with interesting integrations. But there is a lot more to it than that.

This is for our learners/students (we call them recruits):

  The syllabus in the top link gets converted into a bunch of cards that show up on the student's board

And this is for our staff (we call them staff):

## Tech stack

We use JS, not Typescript.

## Community

Join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JHayHBG).

Some channels:

- `#help` is for general questions. For example: "How do I mark a project as complete"
- `#dev` is for developers needing help from the community while developing new features or getting set up
- `#dev-getting-started` is for questions about getting your local environment set up for development.
- `#issue-claim` is for people who want to take on existing issues.

There are also a bunch of voice channels available that you can take over as needed :)

You can run this as a standalone static site, or use it as an input to Tilde.

## Help Wanted!

We want to be able to use this platform and the community built around it to help as many people as we can. If you want to help out there are lots of different things to do:

- Make a PR on this repo. :) We would appreciate code, there's a lot to do.
- Make a PR on our syllabus repo.
- Help our community by hanging out on our Discord server and answering questions.
- Volunteer to help in other ways. We are educators and there are loads of ways to add value to what we do, from code review to mentorship sessions and pair programming sessions.
- Tell your friends
