# TODO

- [ ] see if you can get absolute path imports working
- [ ] make registration gui
- [ ] accessability: add aria labels to everything
      https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/
      see what mantine docs say about it. eg: https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/#accessibility
- [ ] give this a loading state: pages/user-challenge/[registrationId]/components/Step.jsx . Show the user that it's loading when they click on it, redirect takes some time
