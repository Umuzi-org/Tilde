# Contributing 

We are currently in the process of coming up with a better process for issue wrangling so please don't grab an issue and start working on it :) 

## Taking part in the discussion 

We are making use of [Github Discussions](https://github.com/Umuzi-org/Tilde/discussions). There are a bunch of channels for different things. Just jump in and be nice :)

## Making pull requests

If you are making a PR then please use `develop` as the base branch.

If you are poking around the code and see some improvement you would like to make:
- if it's something small like adding documentation or tidying code up, go ahead and make a PR 
- if it's something bigger then it would be good to talk about it first. Please dead over to the [Ideas discussion](https://github.com/Umuzi-org/Tilde/discussions/categories/ideas) and let us know what you want to do.
